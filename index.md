## Welcome

Hi there! My name is David Tetreau. I'm an aspiring Web Developer. You've found my catfacts :cat: blog . I really don't like to keep cats as pets (I'm allergic), but I think cat facts are funny. I'm glad you are here. If you love cat facts, you've landed in the right place! Get ready for some good old fashioned feline fun!
